(** Association tables over ordered types

    This module implements applicative association tables, also known as finite
    maps or dictionaries, given a total ordering function over the keys. All
    operations over maps are purely applicative (no side-effects). The
    implementation uses balanced binary trees, and therefore searching and
    insertion take time logarithmic in the size of the map. *)

  include Map_intf.PMap
